# [Project: "HRSpace Request Builder"](http://185.221.162.231:81)

The HRSpace Request Builder, developed by team number 7 during the HRSpace hackathon, is an MVP for building job vacancy requests on the HRSpace platform. HRSpace is a job marketplace where users can search for jobs or recruit employees. The Request Builder simplifies the process of creating job requests, ensuring that all necessary information is provided.
## Features

- Validation to ensure data integrity: Data validation allows to send only correct data to the server, as well as simplify the use of the app.
- Dynamic form: Dynamic form structure allows you to show only relevant form options for specific jobs. And also show dynamically changing tips.
- Backend communication via API: The project uses API for backend interaction. This allows you to receive all the necessary and up-to-date data, as well as dynamically change the app form.
- Routing: Routing has been implemented to manage different pages of the application.
